            <section class="recipe-intro">
                <p>For thousands of years, yogis and Ayurvedic practitioners have turned to Haldi Doodh (turmeric milk) as a sacred evening ritual. This warming, golden elixir combines the anti-inflammatory power of turmeric with the grounding properties of ghee and the calming sweetness of raw honey creating a perfect tonic for releasing the day's stress and preparing body and mind for restorative sleep.</p>
                
                <p>In Ayurveda, golden milk is considered a sattvic (pure, harmonizing) beverage that balances all three doshas while specifically calming aggravated Vata the energetic force responsible for anxiety, restlessness, and disrupted sleep patterns.</p>

                <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
                
                <h3>Base:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup whole milk (or plant-based milk: coconut, almond, oat)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon <a href="ayurvedic-pantry.html">organic turmeric powder</a> (or 1 inch fresh root, grated)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon <a href="ayurvedic-pantry.html">organic ghee</a> (clarified butter)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon <a href="ayurvedic-pantry.html">raw honey</a> (add after heating, never while hot)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Warming Spices:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder (balances blood sugar)</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon black pepper (increases curcumin absorption by 2000 percent)</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon ginger powder or fresh grated ginger (digestive fire)</li>
                    <li>Pinch of cardamom powder (calming, aromatic)</li>
                    <li>Pinch of nutmeg (promotes deep sleep)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Optional Adaptogens:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon ashwagandha powder (powerful stress reducer)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil (brain fuel for restful sleep)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="instructions">
                <h2>PREPARATION METHOD</h2>
                
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 1: Heat the Milk</h3>
                    <p>Pour milk into a small saucepan. Heat over medium-low flame until warm but not boiling (160-180 degrees F). Boiling destroys the pranic energy and medicinal properties.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Add Turmeric and Ghee</h3>
                    <p>Add turmeric powder and ghee to the warm milk. Stir continuously for 2-3 minutes. The ghee helps dissolve curcumin (fat-soluble) for maximum absorption.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 3: Blend in Spices</h3>
                    <p>Add black pepper, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and nutmeg. Whisk vigorously to create a frothy, well-integrated mixture. If using fresh turmeric or ginger, blend everything in a blender for 30 seconds for smoothest texture.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 4: Sweeten Mindfully</h3>
                    <p>Remove from heat and let cool for 2-3 minutes until drinkably warm (not hot). Add raw honey and stir. Never heat honey in Ayurveda, heated honey becomes toxic and disrupts digestion.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 5: Sip Consciously</h3>
                    <p>Pour into your favorite cup. Sit in a quiet space. Hold the warm cup in both hands. Take slow, mindful sips while practicing deep belly breathing. This ritual signals your nervous system: it's time to rest.</p>

                <div class="wisdom-point">
                    <h3>Evening Ritual Power</h3>
                    <p>Drink golden milk 60-90 minutes before bed as part of your dinacharya (daily routine). This timing allows your body to fully absorb the nutrients and transition into parasympathetic rest-and-digest mode.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="wisdom-point">
                    <h3>Digestive Fire Consideration</h3>
                    <p>If you have weak digestion, reduce the milk quantity to half cup or use warm water as a base. Add extra ginger to kindle your digestive fire.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="wisdom-point">
                    <h3>Dosha Modifications</h3>
                    <p><strong>Vata imbalance (anxiety, insomnia):</strong> Add extra ghee and a pinch of salt</p>
                    <p><strong>Pitta imbalance (irritability, inflammation):</strong> Use coconut milk, reduce ginger</p>
                    <p><strong>Kapha imbalance (lethargy, heaviness):</strong> Use almond milk, add extra black pepper and ginger</p>
                </div>

                <div class="wisdom-point">
                    <h3>Sacred Intention</h3>

                <h2>MODERN SCIENCE CONFIRMS ANCIENT WISDOM</h2>

            <section class="recipe-tips">
                <h2>PRO TIPS FOR MAXIMUM BENEFIT</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quality Matters:</strong> Use organic, high-quality turmeric with 3-5 percent curcumin content. Look for deep orange color and earthy aroma.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fresh is Best:</strong> Fresh turmeric root (when available) contains volatile oils that dried powder lacks. Blend 1-inch fresh root for enhanced benefits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't Skip the Fat:</strong> Curcumin is fat-soluble. Ghee or coconut oil is essential for absorption, not optional.</li>
                    <li><strong>Black Pepper is Key:</strong> Without piperine, your body absorbs only 1 percent of curcumin. Always include freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature Awareness:</strong> Overheating destroys enzymes. Keep flame low and never boil aggressively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency Creates Results:</strong> Drink daily for 21 days to experience transformative effects on sleep quality and stress resilience.</li>
                </ul>
