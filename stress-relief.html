                <!-- Understanding Stress from a Yogic Perspective -->
                <h2>Understanding Stress: The Yogic Perspective</h2>
                <p>Modern stress isn't just mental—it depletes your <strong>Ojas</strong> (vital essence), disrupts your <strong>doshas</strong> (constitutional energies), and creates imbalance in body and mind. Yoga and Ayurveda teach us that stress management isn't about fighting stress—it's about cultivating practices that naturally build resilience.</p>
                
                <p>When Vata dosha (air and space elements) becomes aggravated through irregular routines, excessive mental activity, and poor sleep, stress symptoms intensify: anxiety, restlessness, digestive issues, and depleted energy. The yogic path offers systematic practices to restore balance.</p>

                <!-- The Four Pillars of Yogic Stress Management -->
                <h2>The Four Pillars of Stress Management</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Pranayama: The Science of Breath</h3>
                <p>Your breath is the bridge between body and mind. Scientific research confirms what yogis have known for millennia: controlled breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing cortisol and promoting deep relaxation.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <h4>Three Essential Breathing Practices:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Nadi Shodhana (Alternate Nostril Breathing):</strong> Balances left and right brain hemispheres, calms the nervous system. Practice for 5-10 minutes daily.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bhramari (Bee Breath):</strong> Creates soothing vibrations that quiet mental chatter. Especially effective for anxiety and insomnia.</li>
                        <li><strong>4-7-8 Breathing:</strong> Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. This activates your body's natural relaxation response within minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </blockquote>

                <h3>2. Dinacharya: Daily Rhythm & Routine</h3>
                <p>Ayurveda emphasizes that irregular daily routines are a primary cause of stress and disease. Establishing a consistent <strong>dinacharya</strong> (daily routine) synchronizes your body with natural circadian rhythms.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wake with the sun:</strong> Rise during Brahma Muhurta (45-90 minutes before sunrise) when Vata energy supports meditation and clarity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Morning self-care:</strong> Tongue scraping, oil pulling, and warm water with lemon to flush toxins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Movement practice:</strong> Gentle yoga or walking to circulate energy and release physical tension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular meal times:</strong> Eat your largest meal at midday when digestive fire (Agni) is strongest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Evening wind-down:</strong> No screens 1 hour before bed. Herbal tea, light reading, or meditation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Sattvic Nutrition: Eating for Peace</h3>
                <p>Your food directly influences your mental state. <strong>Sattvic foods</strong>—fresh, pure, and life-giving—promote clarity, calmness, and vitality. Rajasic foods (spicy, stimulating) and tamasic foods (processed, stale) increase agitation and dullness.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Stress-Reducing Sattvic Foods:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="ayurvedic-pantry.html#ghee">Organic Ghee</a>: Nourishes Ojas and calms Vata dosha</li>
                    <li><a href="ayurvedic-pantry.html#honey">Raw Honey</a>: Natural energy that doesn't spike blood sugar</li>
                    <li>Fresh fruits and vegetables (especially leafy greens)</li>
                    <li>Warm, cooked foods over raw and cold</li>
                    <li>Herbal teas: chamomile, tulsi, ashwagandha</li>
                    <li><a href="ayurvedic-pantry.html#triphala">Triphala</a>: Supports digestive health and toxin removal</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Meditation & Mindfulness</h3>
                <p>Meditation isn't about stopping thoughts—it's about changing your relationship with them. Even 10 minutes daily creates measurable changes in brain structure, reducing activity in the amygdala (fear center) and increasing gray matter in areas associated with emotional regulation.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Simple Meditation Practice:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sit comfortably with spine straight</li>
                    <li>Close your eyes and take three deep breaths</li>
                    <li>Focus on your natural breathing rhythm</li>
                    <li>When thoughts arise, notice them without judgment and return to breath</li>
                    <li>Start with 5 minutes, gradually increase to 20+</li>
                </ol>

                <!-- Ayurvedic Herbs for Stress -->
                <h2>Ayurvedic Adaptogens: Herbs That Heal</h2>
                <p>Adaptogenic herbs help your body adapt to stress by regulating cortisol levels and supporting adrenal function.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ashwagandha:</strong> The king of adaptogens. Reduces cortisol by up to 28% in clinical studies. Calms anxiety while increasing energy.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="ayurvedic-pantry.html#triphala">Triphala</a>:</strong> The three-fruit formula that gently detoxifies, supports gut health (where 90% of serotonin is produced), and promotes restful sleep.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="ayurvedic-pantry.html#moringa">Moringa</a>:</strong> Nutrient-dense superfood that provides sustained energy without the crash of caffeine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tulsi (Holy Basil):</strong> Sacred herb that protects against stress-induced damage and promotes mental clarity.</li>
                </ul>
