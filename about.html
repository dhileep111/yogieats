                        <h1>About Yogi Eats</h1>
                        <p>Empowering stress-free living through ancient wisdom and modern understanding</p>
                    </header>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>Yogi Eats was created to bridge the gap between ancient yogic wisdom and modern life's unique stressors. We believe that the timeless teachings of yoga and Ayurveda—refined over thousands of years—offer practical, powerful solutions for managing stress, cultivating inner peace, and living with purpose and vitality.</p>

                    <p>In a world that often feels overwhelming, we provide a sanctuary of authentic knowledge, practical guidance, and compassionate support. Our approach is rooted in three pillars:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Authentic Wisdom:</strong> We share genuine yogic and Ayurvedic teachings, not trendy wellness fads. Every practice and recommendation is grounded in traditional texts and validated by modern science where applicable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Practical Application:</strong> Ancient wisdom must be applicable to modern life. We provide clear, actionable guidance that fits into busy schedules and contemporary contexts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Holistic Approach:</strong> True wellness encompasses body, mind, and spirit. Our content addresses all dimensions of well-being through food, breath, movement, meditation, and mindful living.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
                    <p>Through Yogi Eats, you'll discover:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Stress Management Techniques:</strong> Pranayama (breathwork), meditation practices, and lifestyle adjustments that reduce anxiety and promote mental clarity</li>
                        <li><strong>Ayurvedic Nutrition:</strong> Understanding sattvic foods, dosha balance, and how to use food as medicine for stress relief</li>
                        <li><strong>Sattvic Recipes:</strong> Delicious, nourishing recipes that support mental peace and physical vitality</li>
                        <li><strong>Daily Rituals (Dinacharya):</strong> Morning and evening routines aligned with natural rhythms for optimal well-being</li>
                        <li><strong>Product Guidance:</strong> Recommendations for authentic Ayurvedic ingredients and tools that support your practice</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Our Values</h2>
                    <p><strong>Authenticity:</strong> We honor the depth and integrity of yogic and Ayurvedic traditions. We don't simplify or commercialize sacred wisdom for trends.</p>
                    <p><strong>Education First:</strong> Our primary goal is to educate and empower, not to sell. We believe that understanding the "why" behind practices leads to lasting transformation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> We're honest about what we know, what we're learning, and how we support this work financially (see our affiliate disclosure below).</p>
                    <p><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We promote products and practices that honor the Earth and support ethical, sustainable production.</p>

                    <p><strong>Full Transparency About How We Support This Work</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Yogi Eats is committed to providing high-quality educational content about yogic wellness, stress management, and Ayurvedic living at no cost to our readers. To sustain this mission and continue creating valuable resources, we participate in affiliate marketing programs.</p>

                    <h3>What Are Affiliate Links?</h3>
                    <p>Affiliate links are special URLs that track when a reader clicks from our site to a product and makes a purchase. When you buy through these links, we may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you. The price you pay is exactly the same whether you use our affiliate link or go directly to the seller.</p>

                    <h3>Programs We Participate In</h3>
                    <p>We currently participate in (or are in the process of applying to) the following affiliate programs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Amazon Associates:</strong> We may earn commissions from qualifying purchases of Ayurvedic ingredients, wellness books, yoga props, and related products purchased through our Amazon links.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other Wellness Programs:</strong> We may partner with reputable companies that offer authentic Ayurvedic products and wellness tools that align with our values.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Our Product Recommendation Promise</h3>
                    <p><strong>We only recommend products that:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Align with yogic and Ayurvedic principles:</strong> Every recommended product must support authentic wellness practices, not just generate income.</li>
                        <li><strong>We genuinely believe will benefit you:</strong> We research products thoroughly and, where possible, use them ourselves before recommending.</li>
                        <li><strong>Meet quality and ethical standards:</strong> We prioritize organic, sustainably-sourced, and ethically-produced products.</li>
                        <li><strong>Provide real value:</strong> We focus on foundational items that make a meaningful difference in your wellness journey.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>We will never:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recommend products solely for financial gain</li>
                        <li>Mislead you about a product's benefits or our relationship with sellers</li>
                        <li>Promote products that contradict yogic principles (like synthetic chemicals, factory-farmed ingredients, or exploitative brands)</li>
                        <li>Let affiliate partnerships influence the integrity of our educational content</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Editorial Independence</h3>
                    <p>Our educational content is created independently of any affiliate relationships. We write about yogic practices, Ayurvedic principles, and wellness strategies based on authentic tradition and scientific evidence—not based on which products earn commissions.</p>

                    <p>Product recommendations are added naturally where they support the educational content. For example, when teaching about golden milk, we might suggest high-quality turmeric sources. These suggestions are always optional and supplementary to the free information we provide.</p>

                    <h3>Your Support Matters</h3>
                    <p>When you purchase through our affiliate links, you're directly supporting:</p>

                        <li>Our ability to keep all content freely accessible</li>
                    </ul>
