                <h2>Our Commitment to Transparency</h2>
                <p>At YogiEats, we believe in complete transparency with our readers. This disclosure explains our affiliate relationships and how we may earn income from recommendations made on this website.</p>

                <h2>What are Affiliate Links?</h2>
                <p>Affiliate links are special tracking links that allow us to earn a small commission when you make a purchase after clicking on them. These links don't change the price you pay - you'll pay the same amount whether you use our affiliate link or go directly to the retailer's website.</p>

                <h2>How We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
                <p>YogiEats participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may earn commissions on purchases made through links on our site. These programs may include:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Amazon Associates Program:</strong> We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kitchen Equipment Companies:</strong> We may have affiliate relationships with companies that sell kitchen tools, appliances, and cooking equipment that we recommend.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health Food Retailers:</strong> We may earn commissions from health food stores and specialty ingredient retailers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Book Publishers:</strong> We may earn commissions from books about cooking, nutrition, yoga, and wellness that we recommend.</li>
                    <li><strong>Online Courses:</strong> We may have affiliate relationships with educational platforms offering courses on cooking, nutrition, or wellness.</li>
                </ul>
